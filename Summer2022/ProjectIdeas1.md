Eric Nelson: I would like to work on the same project I am doing for RCOS, NeRF or Neural Radiance Fields. The project will involve creating a consumer application based on NeRF research that allows users to generate 3D renderings of scenes from a collection of 2D images or single video.

William Allen: I plan to work on Submitty for the majority of my open-source contributions this summer.  In particular, I will continue my efforts to improve Lichen, Submitty's plagiarism detection tool.  I also plan to do a considerable amount of reviewing this summer to support the team of full-time developers.  I am also supervising one of Submitty's Google Summer of Code students this summer and will work to overhaul Submitty's code analysis tools.

Michael Robertson: I am not quite sure yet what I would like to work on, however I do have some interest in something connected to the school, such as Shuttle Tracker or Submitty. I plan to look around a bit more to see if something else more specific catches my eye.

Weiting Ye: I'm thinking about doing a project use Text-to-Speech (TTS) Engine or 3-D modeling. Text-to-speech API can create a interface to interact with human generated conventional recorded phone messages. For 3-D modeling, the CAD tool can offer some way to display the design on the user's screen. The difficulty is designing a physical object with 3 dimensions, but the computer screen has only 2 dimensions. I believe there should be a lot of way to approach and get different types of solutions for those project ideas.
